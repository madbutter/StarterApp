playground for ideas around AI Art Today

These experiments revolve around using a couple of AI-enhanced apps to build some AI Art Today website functionality. Some ideas to pursue
1. Use AI to create an automated pipeline to preserve the interviews we have done with prominent AI artists, techs, entrepreneurs, and other "influencers"
2. Similarly, create summaries of spaces after they happen
3. Create a calendar interface to scheduled spaces in the future, which then become a record of links to past spaces
4. Create easy-to-update information pages with links to things like prominent AI tools, contests, opportunities
5. Make some interesting logo and splash page art with web-based coding languages like React, Typescript, next.js, three.js and p5.js
